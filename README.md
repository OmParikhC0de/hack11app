# Sage
Sage, the Eco-Trend Wizard is your magical guide to discovering the latest sustainability trends. We analyze discussions from Reddit, Twitter, and news sources to reveal emerging eco-movements.

Team Members:
Om Parikh, 
Samarjeet Purba

Purpose:
Sage helps users discover sustainability trends and find eco-friendly resources near them. It includes an AI chatbot for eco-tips, daily quests to encourage sustainable habits, and a map to find local farmers markets, thrift stores, and recycling centers.

Tools Used:
React, 
Vite, 
JavaScript, 
CSS, 
Mistral AI API, 
Google Maps Embed API, 
Browser Geolocation API

Problems We Ran Into:
We had dependency issues with the map library after pulling from GitHub.
Google Maps Embed API doesn't support custom markers so we couldn't add a proper "you are here" marker. 
We worked around it by using the place mode with coordinates instead.
